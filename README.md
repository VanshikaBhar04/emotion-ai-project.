Facial Keypoint Detection and Emotion Classification using Deep Learning


##  Project Description
EmotionAI leverages computer vision and deep learning to analyze facial expressions and determine the emotional state of individuals in static images. It uses TensorFlow for model inference and facial feature detection.


##  Features

- Detects key facial landmarks from input images
- Classifies emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.
- Uses pre-trained deep learning models for emotion recognition
- Easy-to-use and extendable for real-time applications

##  Dependencies
- Python 3.10 or 3.11
 TensorFlow >= 2.15
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
